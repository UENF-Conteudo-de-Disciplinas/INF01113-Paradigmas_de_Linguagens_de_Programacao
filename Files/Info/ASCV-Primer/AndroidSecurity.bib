The proposed application is based on the library that uses standard Android OS API and Google SafetyNet library. We followed up modular approach that allows to use our library independently from our application in any stock Android OS version 5.0 and above. Application evaluates overall security level, gives an explanation of the each parameter, gives advices how to improve overall security of the device, and allows to simulate the evaluation that shows how each parameter affects the security level.},

  abstract  = {Android operating system uses the permission-based model which allows Android applications to access user information, system information, device information and external resources of Smartphone. The developer needs to declare the permissions for the Android application. The user needs to accept these permissions for successful installation of an Android application. These permissions are declarations. At the time of installation, if the permissions are allowed by the user, the app can access resources and information anytime. It need not re-request for permissions again. Android OS is susceptible to various security attacks due to its weakness in security. This paper tells about the misuse of app permissions using Shared User ID, how two-factor authentications fail due to inappropriate and improper usage of app permissions using spyware, data theft in Android applications, security breaches or attacks in Android and analysis of Android, iOS and Windows operating system regarding its security.},

  abstract  = {At present, computer science studies generally offer courses addressing mobile development and they use mobile technologies for illustrating theoretical concepts such as operating system, design patterns, and compilation because Android and iOS use a large variety of technologies for developing applications. Teaching courses on security is also becoming an important concern for academics, and the use of mobile platforms (such as Android) as supporting material is becoming a reasonable option. In this paper, we intend to bridge a gap in the literature by reversing this paradigm: Android is not only an opportunity to learn security concepts but requires strong pedagogical efforts for covering all the aspects of mobile security. Thus, we propose teaching Android mobile security through a two-dimensional approach. The first dimension addresses the cognitive process of the Bloom taxonomy, and the second dimension addresses the technical layers of the architecture of the Android operating system. We describe a set of comprehensive security laboratory courses covering various concepts, ranging from the application development perspective to a deep investigation of the Android Open Source Project and its interaction with the Linux kernel. We evaluated this approach, and our results verify that the designed security labs impart the required knowledge to the students.

Although users must grant permission before their personal information is shared, they often do so without knowing the consequences of their decision. Based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates service providers to comprehensively inform users about the purpose and terms of personal data processing, this article examines how increased transparency regarding personal data processing practices in mobile permission requests impact users in making informed decisions. We conducted an online experiment with 307 participants to test the effect of transparency on users’ decisions about and comprehension of the requested permission. The results indicate increased comprehension of data processing practices when privacy policies are transparently disclosed, whereas acceptance rates do not vary significantly. We condense our findings into principles that service providers can apply to design privacy-transparent mobile apps.

  abstract  = {A large amount of mobile applications (Apps) are uploaded, distributed and updated in various Android markets, e.g., Google Play and Huawei AppGallery every day. One of the ongoing challenges is to detect malicious Apps (also known as malware) among those massive newcomers accurately and efficiently in the daily security management of Android App markets. Customers rely on those detection results in the selection of Apps upon downloading, and undetected malware may result in great damages. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based malware detection system called SaaS by leveraging and marrying multiple approaches from diverse domains such as natural language processing (n-gram), image processing (GLCM), cryptography (fuzzy hash), machine learning (random forest) and complex networks. We firstly extract n-gram features and GLCM features from an App’s smali code and DEX file, respectively. We next feed those features into training data set, to create a machine learning detect model. The model is further enhanced by fuzzy hash to detect whether inspected App is repackaged or not. Extensive experiments (involving 1495 samples) demonstrates that the detecting accuracy is more than 98.5%, and support a large-scale detecting and monitoring. Besides, our proposed system can be deployed as a service in clouds and customers can access cloud services on demand.},

  abstract  = {Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is crucial to protect smartphones from imminent security breaches and ensure user privacy. Android is the most popular mobile Operating System (OS), holding above 85% market share. The traffic generated by smartphones is expected to exceed the one generated by personal computers by 2021. Consequently, this prevalent mobile OS will stay one of the most attractive targets for potential attacks on fifth generation mobile networks (5G). Although Android malware detection has received considerable attention, offered solutions mostly rely on performing resource intensive analysis on a server, assuming a continuous connection between the device and the server, or on employing supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for profiling the malware’s behaviour, which essentially require a training dataset consisting of thousands of examples from both benign and malicious profiles. However, in practice, collecting malicious examples is tedious since it entails infecting the device and collecting thousands of samples in order to characterise the malware’s behaviour and the labelling has to be done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel Host-based IDS (HIDS) incorporating statistical and semi-supervised ML algorithms. The advantage of our proposed IDS is two folds. First, it is wholly autonomous and runs on the mobile device, without needing any connection to a server. Second, it requires only benign examples for tuning, with potentially a few malicious ones. The evaluation results show that the proposed IDS achieves a very promising accuracy of above 0.9983, reaching up to 1.},
